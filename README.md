# Hi there 👋 My name is Ryan.

I am an aspiring Data/Financial Analyst. Passionate about solving complex problems and placing myself in situations where I can take on challenges. 

Recent graduate with a Bachelors in Economics with courses focused on econometrics, statistics, and data gathering/collection. I became intrigued by the concept of collecting extensive data. I decided to further my education and this lead me to engage in projects to explore this interest by learning more about SQL, Python, and R.
